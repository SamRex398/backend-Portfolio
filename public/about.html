      <p>
        I am a dedicated backend developer with a strong foundation in modern web technologies. My expertise lies in building robust and scalable server-side applications using JavaScript (Node.js), Express.js, and MongoDB. I have a passion for solving complex problems through efficient code, and I am driven by the desire to continuously learn and adapt to new challenges.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        With a background in backend development and a commitment to continuous improvement, I have honed my skills in crafting reliable and high-performance applications. My journey began with an enthusiasm for understanding how things work behind the scenes, which led me to dive deep into backend technologies. Over time, Iâ€™ve developed a keen eye for detail and a passion for building clean, maintainable code that delivers real-world solutions.

      <p>
        My experience spans across multiple projects, including the development of a Todo app, a dynamic blog platform, and an e-commerce system. Each project has reinforced my ability to handle data management, API design, and server optimization. In addition to my technical skills, I place a strong emphasis on communication, collaboration, and adaptability. These soft skills enable me to work effectively within teams, ensuring that projects are completed smoothly and efficiently.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of coding, I am deeply interested in staying up-to-date with the latest trends in technology, particularly in areas like cloud computing and distributed systems. I am eager to apply my skills in a challenging environment where I can contribute to meaningful projects while continuing to grow as a developer.
